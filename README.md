<h1>Project Overview</h1> <br /> 
Most disabled individuals face obstacles in accessing education from a young age due to their physical, and sometimes mental, limitations. This situation often excludes them from employment, causing difficulties in meeting their needs, especially when they lack family support after the death of each member, in an environment of inflation where the cost of living continues to rise.

To address such circumstances, we propose a website platform that facilitates access to education for disabled children from elementary school to high school, offering them courses in mathematics, Arabic, French, and English through an interface that facilitates their learning. It will be equipped with artificial intelligence to facilitate the use of applications and understanding of the courses. Another key feature is that there will be a communication interface among disabled students to connect and expand their network from a young age, whether in Morocco or elsewhere.
